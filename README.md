## Prerequisites 

This project requires Mac OS running MacOS 13.0+ and Xcode 14.0+ with M1 chipset or higher.

It's also required to acquire photos of objects in USDZ format. 

Please see [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/taking_pictures_for_3d_object_capture) for more Apple documentation to create such app or you can use [sample app](https://github.com/KKodiac/ObjectCaptureAPIExample) I created using Apple's example.


## Reference 
Apple's cli [example](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/creating_a_photogrammetry_command-line_app) for photogrammetry.
